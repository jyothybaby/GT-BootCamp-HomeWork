#01-CodeRefactor.
This folder contain the html and css files for CodeRefactor home work.
Work I have done for this project is:

In index.html,
    * Modified the title of the website for user understanding.
    * Removed Non-Semantic elements (<div>)  from the code and added semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <section>,<article>, <aside>, <main>, <footer> etc.
    * Added "alt" attributes to all <img> Tag.
    * Commented my changes in .html file.
In style.css,
    * Changed the CSS style sheet accoring to the use of semantic elements.
    * Commented my changes in .css file.
